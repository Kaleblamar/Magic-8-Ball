# Magic-8-Ball


This code defines an array of answers and a click event listener that generates a random answer from the array and displays it in the magic 8 ball.

The event listener adds two CSS classes to the "click" element ("shakeBall" and "textZoom"), which trigger animations on the webpage. The "shakeBall" class causes the "click" element to shake, while the "textZoom" class causes the "answer" element to zoom in when it appears. 

The code also hides the "eight" element when an answer is displayed, and removes the CSS classes added to the "click" and "answer" elements once the animations are complete.
